# Upcoming-Concert-Brewery-Locator

## Description ##
Have you ever gotten tickets for a concert at a new venue, but not known where to loosen up beforehand for a couple rounds? Fret no more as we have solved this problem with an application that integrates both the TicketMaster API and a brewery locater API.


## Credits ##
Team member William Mason had a tutoring session with Scott Everett on 11/15/2023. Scott helped Will to write the showTenVenues() function to show ten unique events according to a given ticketmaster search. Thanks Scott!
